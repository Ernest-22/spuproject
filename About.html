        <h2>Welcome to Sol Plaatje University Student Residence</h2>
		
		<p> 
			Sol Plaatje University has 6 student residences in different locations, namely; Mohudi, Tauana, Rathaga, Moroka, Hannetjie and Umnandi.<br>
			<ul>
			<li>Off-campus: Mohudi and Rathaga</li>
			<li>Central campus: Moroka</li>
			<li>South campus: Tauana, Hannetjie and Umnandi</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		All our off campus residences are a (10-15 minutes) walk away from the central campus making it easy to attend classes and access campus resources.
		</p>
		
        <p>
           Residence students at the University identify themselves in many different ways with distinctions that include but are not limited to<br> race, gender, 
		   sexual orientation, national origin, religion, age, ability and life experience.<br>
		   Out of this diversity, we seek to build a community where we are able to balance our desire to explore individual differences with our <br>
		   desire to celebrate common bonds, a community that is equally concerned with our rights as individuals and our responsibilities as members.
        </p>
        <p>
            We understand the importance of having a safe and conducive environment for your studies. 
            Our dedicated staff and numerous amenities ensure that you have everything you need to succeed.
